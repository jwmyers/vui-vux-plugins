# Building for Board

Multi-touch displays have been limited to 10 touch points since the iPhone launched nearly two decades ago. Board removes that limit entirely. Track as many fingers and Pieces as you want, all at once, with no performance penalty.

We've re-engineered the entire touch stack to make this possible. Place a Piece on Board and it knows exactly where it is, which way it's facing, and whether someone's hand is on it. On-device machine learning runs on dedicated hardware, keeping CPU and GPU free for your game. And Board actively filters out noise from palms, wrists, and other unintentional touches.

Build games where everyone plays on the same screen, at the same time, with no compromises.

The Unity SDK is the first way to build for Board. It exposes all of this through familiar touch events. If you've worked with standard multi-touch input, you already know the basics. Board removes the limitations and adds new capabilities.

## What the SDK Provides

**Touch Input** - Piece recognition, finger detection, unlimited contacts, noise rejection, and tracking

**Session Management** - Player profiles and session state

**Save Games** - Persistent storage with player associations

**Pause Screen** - Integration with Board's system pause screen
